#### 1. Comment on your experience with the Git activity that you did in class today. Was it useful? Was it confusing? Did you have time to finish? Did you have merge conflicts? Were you able to resolve them?

I found the class activity to be useful as it helped refresh my memory. I also did run into merge conflicts and I was luckily able to resolve them. The only small confusing thing for me was forking. I've never done this before or used the feature so I wasn't sure the use of it. After some explanation in class, I did leave with some understanding however, I now follow up questions such as, why would someone want to use this and when? Also, what are the benefits that come with forking? I plan to look into it this weekend to find some answers :)

#### 2. What are your reactions to the above on-line readings. Pick one or two that made an impression on you and articulate your thoughts about them.

I really enjoyed reading the first article - A Beginner‘s Very Bumpy Journey Through The World of Open Source and hearing Shubheksha's experience. I could really relate to how they were feeling intimidated and also going through everyone's worst fear of being told “If you can’t figure out how to make the change, you’re not qualified to make the change.”.
